Create container

### `docker run -p 8080:8081 -it go-server-db .`

`-p 8080:8081` - This exposes our application which is running on port 8081 within our container on http://localhost:8080 on our local machine.\
`-it` - This flag specifies that we want to run this image in interactive mode with a tty for this container process.\
`go-server` - This is the name of the image that we want to run in a container.
